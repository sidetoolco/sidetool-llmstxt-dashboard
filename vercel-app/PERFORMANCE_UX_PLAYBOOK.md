# UI/UX & Performance Playbook

## Approach

1. User needs first - design with empathy and data
2. Progressive disclosure for complex interfaces
3. Consistent design patterns and components
4. Mobile-first responsive design thinking
5. Accessibility built-in from the start

Below is a self-contained UI & UX playbook you can treat as a checklist when building your front-end. Every principle is spelled out in the text so you can copy-paste or share it without missing context.

## 1 · Start with timeless usability

* **Apply Nielsen's 10 heuristics**—visibility of system status, real-world match, error prevention, etc.—as non-negotiable gates in every design review. ([DePaul University][1])
* When a screen breaks a heuristic, document the rationale or fix it before shipping. ([DePaul University][1])

## 2 · Lock in visual & behavioral consistency

* **Adopt a design-token system** so color, spacing, radius, and motion values live in one "source of truth" that design files and code both read from. ([Material Design][2])
* **Borrow Apple's mantra—Clarity, Deference, Depth**—to keep dense data UIs legible yet unobtrusive. ([Apple Developer][3])

## 3 · Bake in accessibility & inclusion

* Meet **WCAG 2.2's four pillars** (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust) during development, not retrofits. ([W3C][4])
* Follow Microsoft's rule: **"Solve for one, extend to many,"** designing first for users with permanent disabilities so everyone benefits. ([Microsoft for Developers][5])

## 4 · Design mobile-first, then scale up

* Craft layouts for the smallest viewport, adding progressive enhancement instead of trimming features later. ([GeeksforGeeks][6])
* Set breakpoints around **content needs**, not device widths, a lesson early responsive pioneers emphasized. ([WIRED][7])
* Avoid "pixel-perfect" breakpoints tied to hardware classes; let the grid flow naturally. ([WIRED][8])

## 5 · Treat performance as a UX feature

* Budget for **≤ 1 s perceived load** and **< 100 ms interaction latency**—numbers MDN cites as thresholds where users start doubting responsiveness. ([MDN Web Docs][9])
* Include performance acceptance criteria in every user story, not just an engineering backlog. ([MDN Web Docs][9])

## 6 · Use micro-interactions for clarity & delight

* Add subtle touches—button ripples, inline form validation—that confirm actions and prevent errors without stealing focus. ([Slider Revolution][10])
* Keep amplitudes small: micro-animations should guide attention, not entertain for their own sake. ([Slider Revolution][10])

## 7 · Design for emotion, not just function

* Don Norman's research shows attractive, playful interfaces are **perceived as easier to use** and build stronger bonds with users. ([Interaction Design Foundation][11])
* Balance visceral aesthetics with behavioral utility and reflective meaning—the three levels of emotional design—so delight never compromises clarity. ([jnd.org][12])

## 8 · Iterate with data & real-world feedback

* Pair telemetry with qualitative interviews to refine flows; a **data-informed culture** lets any contributor justify design tweaks with evidence, not opinion. ([Medium][13])
* Ship in small batches, measure impact, and publish in-product changelogs so users see continuous improvement. ([Medium][13])

### Quick sprint checklist

1. Run a heuristic audit on new screens.
2. Validate WCAG 2.2 criteria with automated and manual tests.
3. Prototype mobile-first; add breakpoints only when content demands.
4. Set performance budgets (< 100 ms tap-to-response) per component.
5. Introduce or refine one micro-interaction for feedback or delight.
6. Release, capture metrics, interview users, and repeat.

Apply these layers sequentially—usability → consistency → accessibility → performance → emotion → iteration—and your interface will feel fast, inclusive, and polished from day one.

## Performance Engineering Spec

### Ultimate goal
Ship a user-facing application where every interactive event completes in ≤ 50 ms (99-tile ≤ 100 ms) on modest hardware and average broadband. Anything slower is a bug.

### Performance pillars & actionable tasks

#### 1 — Local-first architecture
• Persist an encrypted, versioned cache of all user-relevant data on the client (disk + RAM).
• Reads must succeed offline; writes enqueue for background sync via conflict-free CRDTs or OT.
• Sync endpoints stream deltas, never whole resources.

#### 2 — Predictive fetch & render
• While the user is on view N, pre-fetch & pre-compute the top K next-likely views (routes, components, assets).
• Use skeleton UIs + speculative DOM diffing so the real content is ready before the user can perceive a delay.

#### 3 — Micro-interactive, keyboard-first UI
• All primary actions have hotkeys; mouse/touch paths are progressive enhancements.
• Avoid full page reloads or heavyweight animations; prefer GPU-cheap transforms.
• Critical CSS/JS ≤ 15 KB each (post-gzip); lazy-load everything else via code-splitting.

#### 4 — Edge-accelerated backend
• Deploy data & auth endpoints at the network edge (≤ 50 ms RTT for 95 % of users).
• Co-locate server functions that generate HTML/JSON next to the CDN nodes; support server-side streaming for progressive hydration.

#### 5 — Instrumentation & guardrails
• Integrate a perf-budget test suite in CI: measure first contentful paint (FCP), interaction to next paint (INP), and custom "actionComplete" timers; fail builds if median > 50 ms or P99 > 100 ms.
• Auto-roll back on perf regressions; dashboards visible to whole team.

#### 6 — Continuous profiling & coarse-grained rendering
• Ship production React or Svelte Profiler hooks; flag components that block main thread > 4 ms.
• Virtualize long lists, recycle DOM nodes, and throttle expensive observers.

#### 7 — Binary & asset discipline
• Enforce < 200 KB total JS transferred on first load; compress with Brotli; serve modern ES2020 bundles.
• Images: AVIF/WebP, responsive sizes, lazy-loaded with content-visibility: auto.
• Fonts: self-host, swap strategy, subset to used glyphs only.

#### 8 — Fail-open offline mode (30-day parity)
• The app stays fully usable without network connectivity for 30 days—feature parity, not a "read-only" stub.
• Service-worker handles asset updates, background sync, and push-driven invalidations.

### Non-negotiables
• No feature ships unless it meets the 50 ms interaction budget.
• Perf metrics are first-class acceptance criteria—tracked next to functional tests.
• All developers run Lighthouse/Tachometer hooks pre-commit; merge blocked on regressions.

### Deliverables for this spec

- Architectural diagram (client ⇄ edge ⇄ core).
- Baseline perf-budget test harness integrated into CI.
- Sample local-first data layer with conflict resolution and delta sync.
- Documentation: coding-standards.md outlining perf guidelines.

Use this prompt as the north-star for design reviews, sprint planning, and code review checklists. Any deviation from the latency budget requires written justification and a mitigation plan.
